# Test Plan: Automated Functional Testing for Sauce Demo

## Introduction
This test plan outlines the approach and procedures for conducting automated functional testing of Sauce Demo, a demonstration site provided by Sauce Labs for testing purposes. The test plan covers the automation of functional tests using the Cypress test automation framework.

## Test Objectives
- Automate functional tests to validate the key features of the Sauce Demo site.

- Identify and address any functional issues or bugs in the site.

- Ensure the stability and reliability of the site's functionality across different browsers and environments.

## Test Environment
- Test Environment: Web
- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Test Automation Framework: Cypress
- CI/CD Environment: GitHub Actions

## Test Execution
- Create automated test scripts for each test scenario using Cypress with Typescript in a systematic manner, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the application's functionality.
- Organize test scripts into logical test suites based on specific functionalities, such as login, inventory, cart, and others, to facilitate efficient testing and maintenance.
- Execute automated tests against the Sauce Demo site using various browsers and environments to assess cross-browser compatibility and ensure seamless user experience.
- Generate detailed test reports that document the test results, highlighting any issues encountered during the testing process, to provide valuable insights for further analysis and improvements.


## Test Reporting
- Generate comprehensive test reports that thoroughly document the execution of automated tests.
- Include pertinent information such as test case identification, description, status (pass/fail), environmental details, and any pertinent screenshots or logs.
- Utilize a standardized defect tracking system to report any defects or issues discovered during testing.
## Test Maintenance:
- Consistently update automated test scripts to accommodate any modifications or enhancements made to the Sauce Demo website.
- Regularly review and revise test cases, as necessary, to ensure alignment with updated site functionalities.
